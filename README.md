//midterm project ideas:
//a. type on keyboard and it will draw letters of the key you type, and assign random color/ sound/ location to the type/. To generate a random type-music poster
//b. type and each letter will be different note (color, shape, sound) and hit print it will generate an abstract collage of the sound piece the audiences interacted with and made.
//c. rotating vinyl on record player: move the mouse to different spot on the vinyl ( the needle will move with the mouse) and different part of the song will come out; press longer the frequency will change.
